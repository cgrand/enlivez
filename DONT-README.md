# Enlive Z

Enlive Z (EZ for short) allows to write relational UIs. Yes, Datalog applied to UIs.

## Why?

We believe that a relational state is superior to a hierarchical state.

We also believe that extracting hierarchical representations from it is counterproductive.

That's why EZ makes it possible to express UIs in a relational language.

## Datalog gets expressive

The theoretical roots of Datalog makes it verbose in practice.

EZ offers an expression-based syntax that internally expands to "regular" Datalog. It's also a departure from Datomic/Datascript-style query language.

In EZ, `(:spouse (:child me))` is equivalent to `[:find ?spouse . :in $ ?me :where [?me :child ?c] [?c :spouse ?spouse]`.

This works because EZ makes the distinction on whether a form appears in *statement* or in *expression* context.

```
statement = ('not' statement+) | (pred top-expr+)
top-expr = (pred expr+) | literal | var
expr = top-expr | '%'
```

When a form is in expression position (that is it appears nested in arguments position of another one) it gets unnested by appending an extra variable to it and replacing itsef by this very same variable in the parent form. Thus `(:spouse (:child me))` first becomes `(:spouse (:child me) spouse#)` because the whole thing is assumed to be in expression context; then `(:child me)` gets unnested: `(:child me child#) (:spouse child# spouse#)`.

The order of arguments to keywords may look unfamiliar in statement context: `(:attr entity value)` or `(:attr entity default value)`  but it's there to enable the nice clojuresque expression syntax. 


## Handlers

Handlers in EZ templates are not functions but expressions. These expressions must evaluate to transaction data.

There are two implicit locals available to handler expressions: `%` for the event and `%this` for the Javascript `this`.

Since handlers expression are, well, expressions you can use any function or macro inside them.

## Queries
A query is either a map, a list or a vector.

A list is a query operation, whose head is amongst `=`, `not=`, `and`, `or` or `not` (and the more experimental `if` and `or-else`).

A vector is either a pattern `[e a v]` or a function call `[(f arg1 .. argN) ret]` (See `enlivez.q/builtins` and `enlivez.q/register-fn` to know or extend available fns.)

However there's an irregularity: at the root of a query, a vector has to be interpreted as a shortand for `and`.

### Query Maps
Many queries can be expressed by using the query-map syntax. This syntax can be seen as a mix
of pattern matching, and destructuring with a pinch of pull syntax.

The core of the syntax is made of only two concepts: pattern matching and defaults. Everything else are shorthands that can be expressed with the core syntax.

#### Pattern matching
Map entries whose keys are keywords (`:db/id` or attributes -- regular or reversed) are pattern entries and their values may be either values, unqualified symbols (or `_`) or maps.

`{:person/birth-year 1978}` matches entities whose `:person/birth-year` attribute is valued to 1978; it's equivalent to `[[_ :person/birth-year 1978]]` in Datomic query language.

`{:person/name name }` retrieves names of entities whose birth year is 1978; it's equivalent to `[:find ?name :where [[?p :person/birth-year 1978] [?p :person/name ?name]]]` in Datomic query language.

`{:person/name name :person/children {:person/name "John"}}` returns names of persons who have one kid named John. `[:find ?name :where [[?p :person/children ?c] [?c :person/name "John"] [?p :person/name ?name]]]`.

The same query could have been expressed as `{:person/name "John" :person/_children {:person/name name}}`.

If a symbol (except `_` of course) is bound twice it must be bound to the same value: `{:person/name name :person/children {:person/name name}}` finds name of person who gave the same name to their kid.

#### Defaults
Map entries whose _values_ are `:or` have defaults maps as keys.

```clj
{:person/middle-name mname
 {mname "-"} :or}
```

#### Shorthands

## Why this Z ?

Z because a Z is a sideways N. Enlive Z achieves the goals that were set for the failed Enlive N.

Z like (Zeno) [lien vers Zeno et le tarpit].

Z to pay homage to Mazinger Z and Dragon Ball Z. (So an Enlive GT or an Enlive Super are not out of question.)

Z like zombie because it's Enlive N raising from the grave.
